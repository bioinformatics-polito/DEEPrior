Description: FusionSelector is an inherently flexible tool based on deep learning that provides a probability value for a gene fusion to be driver in an oncogenic process by exploiting directly the amino acid sequence of the fused protein. Compared to the state of the art tools,  FusionSelector is able to successfully prioritize a greater number of driver gene fusions with a good precision.
